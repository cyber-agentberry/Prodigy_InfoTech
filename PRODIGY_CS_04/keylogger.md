## Prodigy Infotech: Task 04 - Basic Keylogger

This project is a basic keylogger that records and logs keystrokes to a file. It was completed as part of the Prodigy Infotech Cybersecurity Internship to provide a hands-on understanding of system input monitoring and its associated security implications.

## ⚠️ Ethical Considerations

This tool is strictly for educational and authorized purposes only. Using a keylogger on any system without the explicit consent of the owner is illegal and unethical. This project is a demonstration of how such tools function, not an endorsement for their misuse.

## Project Description

The tool records keyboard input and saves each keystroke to a file named keylog.txt. It is built using the pynput library, which allows for cross-platform keyboard monitoring. The program logs standard characters as well as special keys like Shift and Enter.

## How to Run

- Make sure you have the pynput library installed:
pip install pynput
- Navigate to the PRODIGY_CS_04 directory.
- Run the Python script from your terminal:
python3 keylogger.py
The keylogger will begin recording keystrokes. To stop the program, simply press the Esc key on your keyboard.

## Key Learnings

- System Input Monitoring: Gained a practical understanding of how programs can monitor and log keyboard input.

- Python Libraries: Learned to use the pynput library for system-level input control.

- Ethical Hacking: Deepened my appreciation for the ethical responsibilities that come with developing and using cybersecurity tools.
