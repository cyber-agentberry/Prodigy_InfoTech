## Task 02: Simple Image Encryption
## Description

This project is a tool that encrypts and decrypts images using a simple bitwise XOR cipher. It manipulates the pixel values of an image with a secret integer key. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption, allowing the original image to be fully restored. The project utilizes the Pillow and NumPy libraries for efficient image and pixel manipulation.

## How to Run

- Make sure you have Pillow and NumPy installed: pip install Pillow numpy.

- Navigate to the PRODIGY_CS_02 directory.

- Run the Python script:
python [Your_Script_Name].py
Follow the prompts to select an action, provide the image path, and enter your secret integer key.

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used throughout these projects:

- Python 3: The primary programming language.

- Pillow & NumPy: Python libraries for image processing.

- Git & GitHub: Used for version control and project hosting.

- Virtual Environments (venv): For managing project dependencies.

## Key Learnings
- Fundamental Algorithms: Gained practical experience implementing classic algorithms like the Caesar Cipher and the XOR cipher.

- Image Processing: Learned how images are represented as data and how to manipulate pixel values programmatically.

- Git Workflow: Solidified my understanding of git add, commit, pull, and push, including how to manage and resolve divergent branches.

- Python Development: Improved my skills in modular code design, error handling, and managing project dependencies with virtual environments.
